# Wasm try based on @tsodings raylib.js setup

Trying out wasm based on @tsodings setup see his [tsoding/raylib.js](https://github.com/tsoding/raylib.js) for an example

WIP: Demo here [irooc.github.io/Game1/](https://irooc.github.io/Game1/) 

## Building

For windows there is a build.cmd that uses clang which you can run that will build the native and the wasm version. Use your favorite local webserver (node, python3, dotnet) to start a webserver to host the files and navigate to the url.
